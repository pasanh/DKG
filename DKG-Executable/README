DISTRIBUTED KEY GENERATOR (DKG)

+++++++++++++++++
Preparatory Steps
+++++++++++++++++

1. Include all the received certificate and the node's private key in "../certs" 

2. Include NodeID, IP address, port and the leader information in "contlist"
Format:
<NodeID>space<IP Address>space<Port>[<space>L]

Note that [<space>L] is present only for the current leader. If no node is marked with " L", the first node become the default leader

3. To start a DKG node, type 
./launch contlist <If all nodes are on the same machine>
./node [PortNumber] [Public Key File] [Private Key File] [Contact List File] [phase] [CommitmentType 0/1] [Non-responsive-leaders x]

4. Put 0 for the system phase asked if you are starting from the scratch.
If any number > 0 is provided, it is assumed that the node in under recovery

5. CommitmentType: 0 = Feldman_Matrix ; 1 = Feldman_Vector

6. timeout.value tells the nodes how long the protocol is supposed to run in an average case for different parameters, which is a historical hint for the timeout function. For parameters not specified in the file, a node will decide the timeout value depending on what it has seen so far in the current execution of the protocol.

Main Interface Commands
+++++++++++++++++++++++

ping <NodeID> 			: Send a signed ping message to the node <NodeID>

share		  			: share the current secret share (phase > 0) or a random secret (phase = 0)

recover		  			: recover after the node is rebooted

print <parameter>  	: print value for <parameter>. List is as follows.
							id : ID for this node (selfID)
							 n : total number of nodes
							 t : threshold limit
							 f : crash-recovery and link failure limit
							 U : Group Generator for commitments
						 state : state of the node 
							{UNDER_RECOVERY, FUNCTIONAL, AGREEMENT_STARTED, AGREEMENT_COMPLETED, LEADER_CHANGE_STARTED, DKG_COMPLETED}
						 phase : current phase of the node
						leader : current leader of the system
						 share : node's current share
				 confirmLeader : send a leader change message for the first leader (ph = 0)
			  commitmentMatrix : commitment matrix associated with the current share
				   activeNodes : list of currently active nodes (size n)
